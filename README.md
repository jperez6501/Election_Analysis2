## Election-Audit Summary
### After conducting this analysis, this script can be used in a variety of ways. One modification that can be done is to include the total number of eligible voters in each county and compare those number with the voter turnout by county. This can be useful in analysing the percentage of voter turnout by the total number of eligible voters by county. Almost 84% of the votes came from Denver County but are 84% of the eligible voters in this congressional district located in Denver County? Furthermore, we can anaylize what percentage of the eligible voters live in Arapahoe County. If it is greater than 3% of this congressional district then this would identify a huge problem, low voter turnout in Arapahoe County. 
### This script is particularly helpful because it provides us the total number of votes as well as how these votes are distributed amongst candidate. If we add all of the votes that were received by candidate (85,213 , 272,892 , and 11,606), these numbers add up to the toal number of votes which is 369,711. This breakdown is particularly useful in elections because if there were any votes that were not counted or if there was an issue with a vote, we would be able to see how many votes were not distributed amongst the candidates and we could further anaylize the reason why a certain vote was not counted. 
### This election had a winning candidate that won by a landslide. We know this because our script provides the number of votes received by each candidate. Providing a breakout down of votes by candidate is important because if you have an election where a candidate wins by a short amount of votes, it would alert us if there is a need to do a recount of the total votes.
